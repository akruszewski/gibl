# Preface and acknowledgments

This book aims to be accessible to novices that have no prior experience in programming but have some basic working experience with computers. It will also assume some experience with high school mathematics, such as functions. Thus, this book is designed to be self-contained.

One of the reasons for writing this book is that I could not find a single book that explained how to implement blockchain from scratch, covering all the details. I had to do a lot of research on the Internet to come up with a complete picture of what blockchain is, how one can implement it, and what it is good for.

Since it's easy to get distracted by the amount of information, every section will contain a summary to serve as a recall. Moving back and forth between chapters until information sticks can be useful in aiding understanding.

The recommended approach for the book is to follow along and write the code as it's being explained instead of reading passively. This way you will get the most of it. All of the source code is available for download from github.com/bor0/racket-coin.

Thanks to my family, coworkers, and friends for all the support they give to me.

Finally, thank you for purchasing this book! I hope that you will learn new techniques in reading this book and that it will spark up some more interest in Lisp and blockchain.
